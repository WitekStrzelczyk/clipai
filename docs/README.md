## Documentation Areas

| Development | Dev environment and quality tools | [development/](development/) |
| Competitors | Feature analysis of existing clipboard managers | [competitors/](competitors/) |
| Reference | Data model and technical specifications | [reference/](reference/) |
| Architecture | System design and decisions | [architecture/](architecture/) |
| Guides | How-to documentation | [guides/](guides/) |

## Core Concepts

1. **AI-Enriched Capture** - Every clip analyzed and enriched with context
2. **Clipboard History** - Extended storage beyond macOS default (one item)
3. **Snippets** - Reusable text templates for common inputs
4. **Knowledge Base** - Personal knowledge grows passively from clipboard activity
5. **Privacy First** - Local storage, app blacklisting, user control

## Vision Summary

ClipAI differentiates from competitors through AI-powered enrichment. While traditional clipboard managers store history, ClipAI *understands* what you copy:

- **Code snippets** get explanations and language detection
- **Quotes** get source attribution
- **URLs** get metadata extraction
- **Lists** get action suggestions (reminders, calendar events)

See [vision.md](vision.md) for the complete product vision.

## Project Status

Early development phase - building the MVP foundation (Layer 1).
